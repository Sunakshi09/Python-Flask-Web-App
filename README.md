# Python-Flask-Web-App

I make a website with Python, Flask, Authentication, database. I create a new user's account, how you store those in a database, how to log into those user accounts, how to log out of them, how to delete those notes, and how you associate that information with a specific user.

## Setup & Installation

Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed.

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running The App

python main.py

## Lessons Learned

First i thought how i can use flask because i never use before but I did lot of study and learn from my college professor then i start worked on this project. Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python. It's easy to use and doesnâ€™t require any setup or installation process, which makes it perfect for me. A hard lesson i learned was Time Management and Practice.
